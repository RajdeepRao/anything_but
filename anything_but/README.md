A Rails5.0 web application that utilizes HTML5 geolocator and the googlemapsAPI to interface with the Yelp API gem. 

This application filters activity requests based on what a user dislikes. 

# Getting Started 

After cloning the repository, create and migrate the database and run the rails server ``` rails s ```

## Trouble Shooting 

Make sure that you have enabled the geolocator with your browswer otherwise the application will continually search for a location and will not enable the other functionality
